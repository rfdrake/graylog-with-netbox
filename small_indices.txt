I set the indices to be very small.  The main thing about the log server was
that we retained text logs for 2yrs, but only needed to look back for maybe a
couple of weeks for most things.

It's quicker to have elasticsearch only index what you really want to look at.

These were the settings for my Default index set.  I suspect some of it is
incorrect because I don't understand all the fields, but this is to give you
an example of small indices.

Index shards: 4
Index replicas: 0
Max number of segments: 1
Field type refresh interval: 4
Select rotation strategy: Index Size
Max size per index (in bytes): 1.0GiB
Select retention strategy: Delete Index
Max number of indices: 3
